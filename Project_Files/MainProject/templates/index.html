      <p class="card-text">Smart farming, also known as precision farming or precision agriculture, is the use of technology to improve agricultural practices.
          This can include the use of sensors, drones, and other tools to gather data about the condition of crops and soil,
            as well as automated systems for watering and fertilizing. The goal of smart farming is to increase crop yields, reduce the use of resources such as water and fertilizer,
            and improve the overall efficiency of agriculture.
          This can help to feed a growing population while also protecting the environment.</p>
