        <p class="card-text">Smart farming, also known as precision farming or precision agriculture, is the use of technology to improve agricultural practices.
             This can include the use of sensors, drones, and other tools to gather data about the condition of crops and soil,
              as well as automated systems for watering and fertilizing. The goal of smart farming is to increase crop yields, reduce the use of resources such as water and fertilizer,
               and improve the overall efficiency of agriculture.
             This can help to feed a growing population while also protecting the environment.</p>

                Traditionally farming as a practice has been in the past and will continue in the future to be a manual and labor-intensive industry.
                
                With technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), Big data & Analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) touching almost all the listed industry sectors know. 
                How can it no be the case for Agriculture and modern Internet and Communication Technology (ICT) to interact?

A small initiative in the 1990’s by John Deere Co. of using a GPS system in tractors linked to the satellite for automated steering the crop map reducing errors and hence increasing crop yield by reduction in wastage seeds, 
optimum utilization of fertilizers & manures, fuel and time made the way for a full-fledged industry.

According to a report published by Food and Agriculture Organization (FOA) of the United Nations, there are going to be 8.5 billion human beings on planet earth by 2030 and 9.6 billion inhabitants on earth by the year 2050.
 It is estimated that to feed this population, food production must increase by 70% considering limited agriculture land, scarcity of fresh water, and ever-changing climate conditions.

To address this challenge, efforts are in place to improve the quality and quantity of agriculture products by making them ‘Intelligent’ and ‘connected’ through “smart farming” also referred to as “precision farming”.
 Precision agriculture as an industry is poised to grow to 43.4 billion USD by end of 2025

               <h2> Smart farming can be referred</h2> to as the 4.0 green revolution in the field of agriculture combining agriculture methodologies with technology – Sensors & Actuators, 
                Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT), Robotics and Drones to achieve desired efficiencies of production with managed cost.

According to a survey, 80% of farmers in US and 24% farmers in UK have already started using Smart Farming Tool (SFT). These numbers are cognizant of the fact that SFTs are adding value to the farming ecosystem.
 As far as scale of operations is considered, Smart farming tools and techniques can be applied to large scale distributed conventional farming and can be applied to focused small farming set of organic farms.

               <h2> Smart Farming Systems:</h2>
Through remote sensing precisely smart farming system reduces waste, improves productivity and enables improved resource management. For the benefit of micro farming, where multiple crops are grown simultaneously on remote lands requires different care, soil and water. By linking local sensors to smart irrigation and control, things like sensing pH balance of the soil, gauging local temperature is now possible through remote monitoring and sensing rather than walking the field all the time. This leads to increase in the yield as farmers can save on time and focus on the real issues of farming – pest control, irrigation and amending soil conditions all using sensing and automation.

Precision farming system has a lot of dependency on the software management systems. Control systems manage sensory input, delivering remote data for supply and decision support, as well as automation of machines and instruments for acting in response to rising problems and production support. Basically, it is a standardized business approach balancing the demand and supply side with respect to resource management.

On the supply side consider the supply of land, analyzing the conditions – moisture, pH, need for fertilizers.

During production, it is mostly resource management from a growth and yield perspective. For instance, precision seeding using automated tractors to reduce seed loss and seeding with proper space management between different plants. Another example is of precision water delivery.

On the demand side, it is about demand forecasting and delivering goods just in time to reduce waste.
